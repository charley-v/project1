# project1
Write a lexical analyzer(lexer) 

# Description
This project is a lexical analyzer written in C++, the lexical analysis is the first phase of the compiler. The process is it reads the stream of characters making up the source code of a program and dividing the input into tokens. This project contains five files. The FSA design document contains the FSA diagram for the tokens. The main.cpp file contains the main source code for the lexer. Then there is the input and output file. 

# Instructions to Run Project
1. Clone the repository
2. On the input_scode.txt file you can write any code to be tokenized
3. Run the main.cpp file 
4. Tokenization will be outputted to the output.txt file.
